We are looking for a way to efficiently solving​
the challenges in providing sufficient airspace capacity to avoid airspace congestion. ";"Hi, you've reached PlanQK. How can I help you?

Based on your description, your challenge involves optimizing airspace capacity to minimize congestion. PlanQK provides managed services that allow you to deploy quantum and AI solutions without handling infrastructure yourself. You can focus on developing your optimization algorithms (for example, in Python), then containerize and deploy them to the platform. Once your solution is deployed as a managed service, you can execute it asynchronously and retrieve results via a secure HTTP API, which is ideal for long-running optimization tasks like airspace planning [doc5][doc9].

To get started, you can use the PLANQK CLI or platform UI to create and deploy your solution. The CLI offers starter templates and guides for packaging and deploying your code rapidly. After deployment, your team can access the service, integrate it into your workflow, and share it internally or externally as needed [doc5].

Would you like guidance on selecting an appropriate starter template, setting up your development environment, or integrating your data sources for airspace optimization?

2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and maintains the same functionality and syntax as the original Qiskit SDK. Here’s how you can get started:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK  
Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed. The SDK is available on PyPI and can be installed with:
```bash
pip install planqk-quantum
```
[doc1]

2. Create an Access Token  
Log into PLANQK and copy your personal access token from your user settings. This token authenticates your requests and tracks usage costs. If your Qiskit code runs within a PLANQK service, the token is automatically set by the platform and you don't need to provide it manually [doc1][doc2].

3. Setup the Provider in Your Code  
Import the provider and set your access token as shown below:
```python
from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider

planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
```
If running inside a PLANQK service, you can omit the access token parameter [doc1][doc2].

4. List and Select Quantum Backends  
You can list available backends and select one for execution:
```python
backends = provider.backends()
backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
```
[doc2]

5. Execute Your Qiskit Circuit  
Transpile and run your circuit on the selected backend:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)
circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))

circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
```
You can retrieve results, cancel jobs, and manage executions as usual [doc2].

Please note: Running Qiskit code on PLANQK may incur execution costs depending on the backend and number of shots. You can find detailed pricing on the PLANQK pricing page [doc2].

35;We want to reduce hospital readmission rates. Can quantum machine learning help us identify high-risk patients?;"Hi, you've reached PlanQK. How can I help you?

The PlanQK platform provides tools for quantum and machine learning use cases, which may include applications such as risk prediction and patient stratification. You can deploy interactive demos for machine learning models by connecting a GitHub or GitLab repository, and leverage quantum SDKs for advanced analytics and simulations. For healthcare use cases like identifying high-risk patients, you could build or deploy a quantum machine learning model on PlanQK, using the available templates and backend integrations to process relevant data and generate predictive insights [doc1][doc2].

To recommend specific models or workflows, could you share:
- What type of patient data you have available (e.g., structured EHR data, lab results)?
- Are you looking to use an existing model, or develop and deploy your own?

Once I have more details, I can help guide you to the most relevant resources and next steps.

37;Can external factors like weather forecasts or occupancy be included in the optimization?;"Based on the available documentation, external factors such as weather forecasts or occupancy can be incorporated into your optimization workflows on PlanQK by including them as part of your input data and parameters. The platform allows you to structure your input via the Service API in the form of { ""data"": <data>, ""params"": <params> }, which are then provided to your service for processing. This means you can design your quantum or AI code to utilize these external factors during execution, enabling more comprehensive optimization scenarios tailored to your requirements [doc5].
