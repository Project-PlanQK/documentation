      "response": "Hi, you've reached PlanQK. How can I help you?\n\nBased on your description, your challenge involves optimizing airspace capacity to minimize congestion. PlanQK provides managed services that allow you to deploy quantum and AI solutions without handling infrastructure yourself. You can focus on developing your optimization algorithms (for example, in Python), then containerize and deploy them to the platform. Once your solution is deployed as a managed service, you can execute it asynchronously and retrieve results via a secure HTTP API, which is ideal for long-running optimization tasks like airspace planning [doc5][doc9].\n\nTo get started, you can use the PLANQK CLI or platform UI to create and deploy your solution. The CLI offers starter templates and guides for packaging and deploying your code rapidly. After deployment, your team can access the service, integrate it into your workflow, and share it internally or externally as needed [doc5].\n\nWould you like guidance on selecting an appropriate starter template, setting up your development environment, or integrating your data sources for airspace optimization?\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?"
