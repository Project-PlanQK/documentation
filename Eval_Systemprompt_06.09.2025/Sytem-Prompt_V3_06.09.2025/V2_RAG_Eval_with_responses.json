PlanQK provides managed quantum services that can help address complex optimization challenges like airspace congestion by leveraging quantum computing solutions.

PlanQK automates the containerization and deployment process, making your solutions accessible via standard HTTP APIs, and enabling asynchronous execution and result retrieval for long-running optimization tasks [doc1][doc2][doc4][doc6].\n\nTo get started, you may:\n- Use the PlanQK CLI or the platform UI to create and deploy a managed quantum service for your optimization problem.\n- Select or customize starter templates to rapidly prototype your solution.\n- Integrate with quantum backends (such as Qiskit or AWS Braket) using the PlanQK Quantum SDK, which allows you to run and monitor quantum jobs programmatically [doc3][doc10].\n- Share your deployed services securely with colleagues or external partners and orchestrate workflows using the platform’s workflow editor.\n\nCould you provide more detail on your data structure, current workflow, or readiness to prototype?
