2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and maintains the same functionality and syntax as the original Qiskit SDK[doc1]. To get started:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK using Python 3.11 or higher:
   ```
   pip install planqk-quantum
   ```
2. Obtain a valid PLANQK access token from your user settings on the platform. This token is used for authentication and tracking usage costs[doc1].
3. In your Qiskit code, import PlanqkQuantumProvider and pass your access token:
   ```python
   from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
   planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
   provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
   ```
   Note: If running within a PLANQK service, the access token is set automatically by the platform[doc1].

4. List and select the desired backend:
   ```python
   backends = provider.backends()
   backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")  # example backend
   ```

5. Create and transpile your Qiskit circuit, then execute it:
   ```python
   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
   circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
   circuit.h(0)
   circuit.cx(0, 1)
   circuit.cx(1, 2)
   circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
   circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)

12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To verify that your model is processing the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should examine the output returned by your service's run() method. The PlanQK runtime passes the input data (in JSON format) and parameters to your model's run() method, either as dictionaries or Pydantic models. After execution, the run() method should return a JSON-serializable object—typically a dictionary or Pydantic model—which represents your model's result. This output is then accessible via the GET /{id}/result endpoint of the Service API, allowing you to inspect the returned data and confirm that your model has processed the input as expected. For example, if your run() method returns {""sum"": 6}, you can retrieve and review this result using the result endpoint to validate correctness. Additionally, you may want to check any files written to /var/runtime/output, as these are treated as output of the service and can provide further verification of the processing steps performed by your model [doc1].
