2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK’s quantum backends using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and provides seamless integration with the supported quantum hardware and simulators.

Here are the main steps:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed.
   - Install the SDK from PyPI:
     ```bash
     pip install planqk-quantum
     ```
   - This SDK retains the same functionality and syntax as Qiskit, so you don’t need to modify your existing code structure [doc1].

2. Acquire a PlanQK Access Token:
   - Sign up or log in to your PLANQK account.
   - Create or copy your personal quantum access token from your account settings.
   - Store this token securely; you'll need it to authenticate your requests and track usage costs [doc1].

3. Update Your Qiskit Code to Use PlanQKQuantumProvider:
   - Import PlanQKQuantumProvider and use your access token:
     ```python
     from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
     planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
     provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
     ```
   - If running inside a PLANQK service, the token is set automatically by the platform [doc1][doc2].

4. Select a Backend and Execute:
   - List available backends:
     ```python
     backends = provider.backends()
     ```
   - Select a backend (e.g., IonQ simulator):
     ```python
     backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
     ```
   - Prepare and transpile your circuit as usual, then execute:
     ```python
     from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
     circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
     circuit.h(0)
     circuit.cx(0, 1)
     circuit.cx(1, 2)
     circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
     circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
     job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
     ```
   - You can retrieve, monitor, or cancel your job as needed [doc2].

5. Cost Awareness:
   - Running jobs incurs costs based on backend and number of shots.
   - Check the pricing page for backend-specific details [doc2].

1. Local Testing with PLANQK CLI and API Docs
You can run your service locally using the PLANQK CLI. This exposes the same HTTP endpoints as the deployed service, allowing you to interactively test your model’s input and output:

- Start your local server: 
  ```bash
  planqk serve
  ```
- Open http://localhost:8081/docs to access the interactive API documentation.
- Use the POST / operation: Click ""Try it out,"" provide a sample JSON payload for ""data"", and execute.
- The response will include an execution ID. Use GET /{id} to check the status.
- Once the status is SUCCEEDED, use GET /{id}/result to retrieve and inspect the output. This allows you to verify if the returned results match your expectations for the provided input data.

This approach gives you a quick feedback loop for debugging and validation before deploying your model to the platform source: https://docs.planqk.de/quickstart.html.

2. Service Output Inspection
The PLANQK Service API is designed to return results as JSON-serializable objects. You can inspect the output of your run() method—whether it’s a dictionary or Pydantic model—by retrieving the result via the GET /{id}/result endpoint. This lets you confirm that the output format and content are correct for your test inputs source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed-runtime-interface.html.

3. Data Pools for Larger or Reusable Inputs
If you want to test your model with larger datasets or reuse shared data, you can leverage PlanQK’s data pool feature. Reference the data pool file in your input payload and run the service as described above. This ensures your model correctly handles data from both direct JSON input and shared data pools source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/using-a-service.html.

13;Can I test a service without having programming knowledge?;"Absolutely! On PlanQK, you can test and use services without needing any programming knowledge. The platform is designed to be accessible for users of all backgrounds—including those who are not developers.

Here’s how you can do it:

- Service Orchestration: PlanQK provides a workflow editor based on BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), which lets you build larger services from existing ones by visually arranging service calls in a workflow. You can set up and deploy these workflows with no code required. This way, you can connect different services and use their outputs as inputs for others, all through a graphical interface rather than writing scripts or code. This is perfect for users who prefer visual tools over programming! source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/orchestration/introduction.html

- Using Services: You can subscribe to services directly from the PlanQK platform (either internally published or via the marketplace). The platform guides you through the process with buttons and dialogs—no coding necessary. After subscribing, you can execute services by providing input data and parameters using easy-to-follow forms or by using pre-defined workflows. source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/using-a-service.html

- Demos: PlanQK offers deployable demos and starter templates that you can launch and interact with via the web interface. These demos are designed for quick onboarding and allow you to experiment with quantum and AI services without technical setup. source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/using-a-service.html

17;Is it possible to compare two services in terms of efficiency and runtime?;"Yes, you can compare two services in terms of efficiency and runtime on the PlanQK platform, but the process involves a bit of hands-on experimentation and data collection. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. Subscribe to Both Services  
First, ensure you have access to both services you want to compare. You can subscribe to services either internally (for your organization) or via the PlanQK Marketplace. Once subscribed, you’ll receive the endpoint URLs and can execute the services as needed [doc1][doc9].

2. Execute Each Service with the Same Input  
Use the same input data and parameters when invoking both services to ensure a fair comparison. You’ll use the service API (typically a POST request with JSON input) to trigger execution [doc3][doc8][doc9].

3. Collect Runtime Data  
PlanQK services execute asynchronously, meaning you submit a job and then poll endpoints to check status and retrieve results. To compare runtime:
- Record the submission time of your job.
- Poll for status until completion and note the finish time.
- The difference gives you the execution time for each service .

4. Assess Efficiency  
Efficiency can refer to resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU), accuracy, or other performance metrics depending on your service’s purpose. You can:
- Check the resource allocation defined in each service’s planqk.json (e.g., CPU, memory, GPU type/count) [doc6].
- Analyze the output quality, error rates, or result completeness based on your application needs.

5. Repeat as Needed  
Run several tests with different datasets or parameters to get statistically significant results.

If you need a more automated or visual approach, consider using PlanQK’s Service Orchestration and Workflow Editor to set up comparative workflows and aggregate results more easily [doc4].

28;What kind of data preprocessing is required before passing text to the quantum model?;"To pass text data to a quantum model on PlanQK, you'll need to handle a few key preprocessing steps. PlanQK services expect input data in JSON format, so your raw text must be converted into a structure that the service can accept. Here are the general steps and considerations:

1. Text Encoding:  
 - Most quantum models (especially NLP or optimization services) require text to be tokenized or converted to numerical form before execution. Typical preprocessing includes:
  • Tokenization (splitting text into words, subwords, or characters).
  • Optionally, converting tokens into integer indices based on a vocabulary.
  • For some models, embedding representations may be needed, but if the service handles this internally, you only need to submit the raw or tokenized text.

2. JSON Formatting:  
 - Package your preprocessed data as a JSON object, e.g.:
  { ""data"": { ""text"": ""your preprocessed text"" }, ""params"": { … } }
 - Input must be passed as a JSON map, either directly or by reference to a data pool file if large (over 1MB) [doc3].

3. Service-specific Requirements:  
 - Each quantum model or service on PlanQK may have specific expectations about input data structure. Always check the API documentation or the OpenAPI schema provided for the service to see required fields (e.g., { ""data"": { ""values"": [...] }, ""params"": { ... } } for numerical input) [doc4][doc5].
 - If using custom containers, test your input locally by placing your JSON-formatted data in input/data.json before running your service [doc10].

4. Size Considerations:  
 - Direct JSON input is limited to 1MB. For larger datasets, use the data pool mechanism and pass a reference object instead [doc3].

5. Additional Preprocessing:  
 - Depending on the quantum algorithm, you may need to normalize, clean, or filter your text data, especially if the model is sensitive to input quality.

To implement custom constraints:
- You would define your input data structure to reflect specific requirements, such as unavailable days (vacations) or required skills/qualifications per role.
- The quantum algorithm is then constructed so that solutions violating these constraints are penalized or excluded, typically by encoding the constraints into the cost function or problem Hamiltonian.
- When using PlanQK’s Service API, your input JSON can include fields for these constraints. For example, you might pass a list of unavailable days per employee or required qualifications per shift in the ""data"" or ""params"" section of your job input. The backend runtime will pass these to your algorithm implementation, which should handle them appropriately in the optimization step. You can use Pydantic models to define and validate these inputs in your service code for robustness and clarity [doc5].

Would you like help with a specific algorithm or guidance on encoding these constraints in your optimization model? If you share more details about your use case (e.g., workforce scheduling, resource allocation), I can point you to relevant PlanQK tutorials or algorithm templates.

36;We manage a portfolio of smart buildings. Can quantum computing help optimize heating and cooling schedules to reduce energy consumption?;"Absolutely! Quantum computing has strong potential to optimize complex scheduling problems like heating and cooling in smart buildings, where the goal is to balance comfort, cost, and energy use. These types of problems often involve a huge number of variables and constraints—making them ideal candidates for quantum-enhanced optimization.

On the PlanQK platform, you can leverage quantum algorithms and backends to tackle these kinds of combinatorial optimization tasks. For example, quantum annealers (like those provided by D-Wave, accessible via PlanQK) are well-suited for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, which map directly to scheduling and resource allocation challenges in building management.

Here’s how PlanQK can support your use case:

37;Can external factors like weather forecasts or occupancy be included in the optimization?;"Absolutely! External factors such as weather forecasts and occupancy data can be integrated into your optimization workflows on PlanQK. These types of data are commonly used as inputs for AI/ML and quantum optimization services, especially in domains like energy management, logistics, and smart buildings.

Here’s how you can approach this on PlanQK:

- Data Integration: You can design your service or workflow to accept external data (e.g., weather, occupancy) as part of the input payload. For example, you might structure your input data to include time series from weather APIs or occupancy sensors.
- Service Orchestration: With PlanQK’s workflow editor, you can combine multiple services—such as a weather data retrieval service, occupancy prediction, and an optimization solver—in a single orchestrated flow. Each service node can process or transform the data as needed before passing it to the next step in the workflow .
- Custom Services: If your optimization requires custom logic or integration with external APIs, PlanQK allows you to implement and deploy custom services (using Python, Docker containers, etc.) that fetch and preprocess external data before running the optimization algorithm [doc4].
- Use Cases: Many PlanQK use cases involve integrating external factors to improve solution quality. For example, smart grid optimization often includes weather and usage forecasts as part of the input data set [doc10].

If you want to get started, I recommend:

38;What is the goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule on a quantum computer?;"The goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule (H₂) on a quantum computer is to solve quantum chemistry problems more efficiently than classical computers can. Specifically, quantum computers can model the electronic structure of molecules by simulating their quantum behavior directly, using algorithms like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) or Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE).

For the hydrogen molecule, this means computing its ground state energy and understanding its chemical properties with higher accuracy and less computational overhead. Simulating H₂ is considered a foundational benchmark in quantum computing research because it's the simplest molecule with electron correlation, making it a useful starting point for testing quantum algorithms and hardware capabilities. Success in simulating hydrogen paves the way for tackling larger, more complex molecules relevant to material science and pharmaceuticals.

Are you interested in running such simulations on PlanQK, or do you want to learn more about specific quantum chemistry algorithms available on the platform? I can guide you to relevant tutorials and services!

39;Which dataset and features are typically used in fraud detection quantum models?;"Fraud detection quantum models typically rely on datasets that contain transaction-level information—these can be sourced from financial institutions, credit card companies, or simulated environments for benchmarking. While the specific dataset used will depend on the business context and data availability, common features include:

- Transaction amount
- Timestamp/date
- Merchant category
- Location (e.g., IP address, country)
- Device information
- Account age
- Historical transaction patterns
- Flags for previous fraud detection
- User/customer identifiers
- Transaction type (online/in-store, payment/refund, etc.)
- Unusual transaction frequency or volume

In quantum machine learning, these features are often encoded into quantum states (using techniques like amplitude encoding or angle encoding) so that quantum algorithms—such as Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), or Quantum Kernel methods—can process them for classification tasks.

PlanQK does not enforce a specific dataset, but when creating a use case for fraud detection on the platform, you should thoroughly describe your dataset, features, and how they map to your quantum model. The “Details” tab of a use case is the recommended place to document the initial problem statement, dataset properties, and feature engineering decisions. You can also link associated services, algorithms, and data pools relevant to your use case in the “Relations” tab for better traceability and reproducibility. This documentation helps collaborators and interested users understand your approach and the data you used for quantum fraud detection modeling. For more on documenting datasets and features for your quantum use case, see: source: https://docs.planqk.de/community/use-cases.html
