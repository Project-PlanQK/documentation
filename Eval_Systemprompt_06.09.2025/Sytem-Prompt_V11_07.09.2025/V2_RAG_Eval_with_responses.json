      "response": "Great to meet you! For airspace capacity optimization and congestion avoidance, quantum computing and advanced AI techniques can offer powerful new approaches—especially for complex, combinatorial problems like air traffic flow and resource allocation.\n\nPlanQK is designed exactly for these kinds of industrial optimization challenges. Here’s how you can leverage PlanQK for your use case:\n\n### Relevant Capabilities for Airspace Optimization\n\n- **Managed Quantum Services**: You can deploy custom quantum algorithms (e.g., for scheduling, route optimization, or congestion prediction) on PlanQK without managing any infrastructure. This allows you to focus on developing quantum solutions in Python (or other supported languages), which PlanQK then containerizes and exposes via secure APIs. You submit jobs asynchronously and retrieve results when ready—ideal for computationally intensive tasks like variational circuit training or large-scale optimization. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction\n- **Use Case Sharing and Collaboration**: The platform encourages sharing industrial use cases that exploit quantum algorithms for solving subproblems—so you can document, collaborate, and even publish your optimization approach for feedback and visibility within the quantum community. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/use-cases\n- **Starter Templates and SDKs**: Rapid prototyping is possible using PlanQK’s starter templates and CLI tools. You can get up and running with sample code and templates specific to quantum providers or build your own algorithms from scratch. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction\n- **Workflow Orchestration**: For complex processes, use the Workflow Editor to combine multiple quantum and classical services—perfect for integrating optimization, simulation, and prediction steps in an airspace management pipeline. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/orchestration/introduction\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Explore Related Use Cases**: Review quantum optimization examples and see how other industrial players approached similar problems. You’ll find descriptions, algorithm choices, and results for inspiration. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/use-cases\n2. **Prototype an Optimization Algorithm**: Use the Managed Services feature to develop and deploy a quantum optimization algorithm tailored to airspace congestion—e.g., using Qiskit or D-Wave for combinatorial optimization, like maximum independent set, vehicle routing, or scheduling.\n3. **Rapid Deployment**: Use the CLI or UI to deploy your algorithm, expose it as a secure API, and run jobs asynchronously. You can easily test with real-world data, iterate, and scale your solution. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction\n4. **Collaborate and Publish**: Document your use case, share results, and collaborate with others in the PlanQK community to refine your approach and stay at the cutting edge. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/overview\n\nWould you like to see a specific algorithm example (e.g., quantum scheduling, airspace partitioning)? Or are you interested in how to integrate PlanQK with your existing data and workflows? I can guide you through setup or provide references to relevant starter templates and tutorials!\n\nIdentified persona: Business"

Here’s a step-by-step guide to get started:\n\n1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK  \nYou’ll need Python 3.11 or higher. Install the SDK from PyPI using:\n```bash\npip install planqk-quantum\n```\n2. Obtain an Access Token  \nLog in to your PLANQK account and copy your personal quantum access token from your user settings. This token authenticates your requests to the PLANQK platform and tracks usage costs.\n\n3. Update Your Qiskit Code  \nImport the PlanqkQuantumProvider and pass your access token. For example:\n```python\nfrom planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider\n\nplanqk_token = \"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\nprovider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)\n```\nIf you run your Qiskit code inside a PLANQK service, the access token is automatically set by the platform, so you can omit the access_token parameter.\n\n4. Select a Quantum Backend  \nList available quantum backends and select one, for example:\n```python\nbackends = provider.backends()\nbackend = provider.get_backend(\"azure.ionq.simulator\")\n```\n\n5. Execute Your Qiskit Circuit  \nTranspile your circuit for the selected backend and execute:\n```python\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile\n\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)\ncircuit.h(0)\ncircuit.cx(0, 1)\ncircuit.cx(1, 2)\ncircuit.measure(range(3), range(3))\n\ncircuit = transpile(circuit, backend)\njob = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)\n```\nYou can manage your jobs (retrieve results, cancel jobs, etc.) through the job object or the PLANQK web UI.\n\n6.
