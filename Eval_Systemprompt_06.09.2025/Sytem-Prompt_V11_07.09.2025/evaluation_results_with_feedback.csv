We are looking for a way to efficiently solving​
the challenges in providing sufficient airspace capacity to avoid airspace congestion. ";"Great to meet you! For airspace capacity optimization and congestion avoidance, quantum computing and advanced AI techniques can offer powerful new approaches—especially for complex, combinatorial problems like air traffic flow and resource allocation.

PlanQK is designed exactly for these kinds of industrial optimization challenges. Here’s how you can leverage PlanQK for your use case:

### Relevant Capabilities for Airspace Optimization

- **Managed Quantum Services**: You can deploy custom quantum algorithms (e.g., for scheduling, route optimization, or congestion prediction) on PlanQK without managing any infrastructure. This allows you to focus on developing quantum solutions in Python (or other supported languages), which PlanQK then containerizes and exposes via secure APIs. You submit jobs asynchronously and retrieve results when ready—ideal for computationally intensive tasks like variational circuit training or large-scale optimization. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction
- **Use Case Sharing and Collaboration**: The platform encourages sharing industrial use cases that exploit quantum algorithms for solving subproblems—so you can document, collaborate, and even publish your optimization approach for feedback and visibility within the quantum community. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/use-cases
- **Starter Templates and SDKs**: Rapid prototyping is possible using PlanQK’s starter templates and CLI tools. You can get up and running with sample code and templates specific to quantum providers or build your own algorithms from scratch. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction
- **Workflow Orchestration**: For complex processes, use the Workflow Editor to combine multiple quantum and classical services—perfect for integrating optimization, simulation, and prediction steps in an airspace management pipeline. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/orchestration/introduction

### Next Steps

1. **Explore Related Use Cases**: Review quantum optimization examples and see how other industrial players approached similar problems. You’ll find descriptions, algorithm choices, and results for inspiration. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/use-cases
2. **Prototype an Optimization Algorithm**: Use the Managed Services feature to develop and deploy a quantum optimization algorithm tailored to airspace congestion—e.g., using Qiskit or D-Wave for combinatorial optimization, like maximum independent set, vehicle routing, or scheduling.
3. **Rapid Deployment**: Use the CLI or UI to deploy your algorithm, expose it as a secure API, and run jobs asynchronously. You can easily test with real-world data, iterate, and scale your solution. source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction
4. **Collaborate and Publish**: Document your use case, share results, and collaborate with others in the PlanQK community to refine your approach and stay at the cutting edge. source: https://platform.planqk.de/community/overview

2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and provides the same functionality and syntax as the original Qiskit SDK. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get started:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK  
You’ll need Python 3.11 or higher. Install the SDK from PyPI using:
```bash
pip install planqk-quantum
```
2. Obtain an Access Token  
Log in to your PLANQK account and copy your personal quantum access token from your user settings. This token authenticates your requests to the PLANQK platform and tracks usage costs.

3. Update Your Qiskit Code  
Import the PlanqkQuantumProvider and pass your access token. For example:
```python
from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider

planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
```
If you run your Qiskit code inside a PLANQK service, the access token is automatically set by the platform, so you can omit the access_token parameter.

4. Select a Quantum Backend  
List available quantum backends and select one, for example:
```python
backends = provider.backends()
backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
```

5. Execute Your Qiskit Circuit  
Transpile your circuit for the selected backend and execute:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)
circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))

circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
```
You can manage your jobs (retrieve results, cancel jobs, etc.) through the job object or the PLANQK web UI.

6. Cost Considerations  
Running circuits on PlanQK may incur costs depending on the backend and the number of shots. Check the pricing page for details.

For more detailed instructions and examples, see the official tutorial:

3;How do I authenticate with the PlanQK SDK to run quantum programs?;"To authenticate with the PlanQK Quantum SDK and run quantum programs, you need a valid PlanQK account and an access token. Here’s how you do it:

1. Create a PlanQK account: Sign up on the PlanQK platform if you haven’t already.
2. Obtain an access token: Log in to PlanQK and copy your personal access token from your user settings. You can also create a dedicated access token for specific use cases. Store this token securely.
3. Use the token in your code: When you use the PlanQKQuantumProvider object in your Qiskit code, pass the access token as a parameter. For example:
```python
from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
```
If you run your Qiskit code within a PlanQK service, the platform automatically sets the access token for you, so you don’t need to include it manually. If you do provide it, it will be replaced by the service token.

This token is used to authenticate your requests and track quantum execution costs on the platform. For more details on managing tokens, refer to your PlanQK account settings.

12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To check whether your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should use the following practical steps tailored for managed services:

1. Review Your Input & Output Schema:
   - Define your input data and parameters clearly in your OpenAPI specification (using e.g., Pydantic models for Python). This ensures the structure matches what your model expects and what PlanQK will send to your run() method [doc4][doc2].
   - You can use the CLI command planqk openapi to generate and verify your OpenAPI description against your code, confirming the correct types and schema [doc5].

2. Local Testing:
   - Before deploying, run your service locally using planqk serve. This launches your code in a local containerized environment, exposing the same HTTP endpoints PlanQK uses. You can send test requests and inspect both input and output in real time [doc5].
   - Test with different payloads, especially edge cases, to ensure your run() method correctly parses and processes the input data and parameters [doc4].

3. Inspect Output:
   - Your run() method should return a JSON-serializable object (such as a dictionary). This output is what you’ll see when you query the result endpoint (GET /{id}/result) after a service execution [doc4][doc10].
   - Use the result endpoint to check whether the output matches your expectations for the given input.

4. Use Logs:
   - You can retrieve execution logs via GET /{id}/log to debug and verify how your model processes the data step-by-step [doc10].

5. Automated Validation:
   - Consider writing unit tests for your run() method locally, ensuring that known inputs produce expected outputs before you push and deploy.

13;Can I test a service without having programming knowledge?;"Yes, you can test a service on PlanQK without having programming knowledge! PlanQK provides a workflow editor for service orchestration, which lets you build and test composite services using a graphical interface—no coding required. You can set up workflows by visually connecting services, configuring data objects, and linking outputs/inputs between them. Once your workflow is ready, you can deploy and execute it directly from the platform. You only need to save your edits and publish the workflow, then trigger its execution from your service details page. This makes it easy for non-programmers to experiment with service combinations and see results in a user-friendly way [doc1][doc2].

14;What permissions do team members have based on their role in an organization?;"On the PlanQK platform, team members in an organization can be assigned one of several roles, each with different permissions:

- Viewer: Can see the content of the organization, but cannot edit or create content.
- Maintainer: Can create new content, edit existing content, but cannot delete content.
- Owner: Can create, edit, and delete all content of the organization. Owners can also add new members, assign them different roles, and remove members. Additionally, the owner can view and edit the entire organization profile.

When a member is added, they receive an email invitation that must be confirmed before they can see the organization in their account context menu. It’s important to select the correct account context before creating new content, as you cannot change the context afterward [doc4].

15;How can I limit resource usage during service setup to stay within budget?;"To limit resource usage during service setup on PlanQK and stay within budget, you should configure the allocated resources for your service during the setup phase. PlanQK allows you to define the number of virtual CPU cores, the amount of memory (in GB), and even GPU resources for each service at runtime. By adjusting these parameters, you can control the computational resources your service will consume, helping you manage costs effectively.

Here’s how you can do this:

- When creating or configuring your service (whether using the Python Template or a custom Docker container), specify resource limits appropriate for your budget and use case.
- In the service configuration, set the desired CPU, memory, and optional GPU amounts. For example, you might allocate just 1 CPU and 512 MiB memory for lightweight services.
- You can always update these resource limits later from the service details page on the PlanQK platform.

This approach ensures your service does not consume more resources than you intend, keeping operational costs predictable and within budget.

17;Is it possible to compare two services in terms of efficiency and runtime?;"Yes, you can compare two PLANQK services in terms of efficiency and runtime, but the process depends on how each service is implemented and executed.

- Efficiency: This typically refers to how well a service uses computational resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and how it solves the given problem (e.g., solution quality, resource consumption). PLANQK allows you to specify resource allocations in the planqk.json file, such as CPU, memory, and GPU type/count, for each deployed service, which helps standardize the comparison environment for both services [doc4].

- Runtime: PLANQK services are executed via managed APIs, where you submit an execution request and can poll for the result. This makes it possible to measure and log execution times for each service. Since some quantum/AI jobs might take significant time (e.g., training variational circuits), PLANQK’s API design lets you track the start and completion times for each run, so you can benchmark runtime directly [doc2].

For an objective comparison, you would:
1. Deploy both services using similar resource configurations (adjusting CPU, memory, GPU, etc. in planqk.json).
2. Execute both services on the same input data and parameters.
3. Monitor runtime using PLANQK’s service API endpoints for status/result polling.
4. Analyze efficiency by considering resource usage (from logs or PLANQK dashboard) and solution quality (accuracy, cost, or other relevant metrics).

You can automate this process using the PLANQK CLI and SDK, and optionally orchestrate multiple service calls in workflows for more complex benchmarking scenarios [doc5].

Would you like guidance on setting up such a benchmark, or do you have specific services you want to compare? If you provide more details, I can offer tailored steps or code examples.

27;Which types of input data were used to train the quantum model in this battery case?;"Based on the PlanQK documentation, the platform allows you to define and utilize various input data types for quantum models and services. In general, input data for a service should encode the actual problem to be solved, such as entries of a QUBO matrix, or in a more generic example, a list of numerical values to be processed by the quantum algorithm. These inputs are typically provided as JSON objects through the Service API, structured as { ""data"": <data>, ""params"": <params> }, where ""data"" contains the main problem information and ""params"" includes additional execution parameters (such as whether to round a result) [doc1][doc2][doc3][doc10].

For quantum model training—such as in a battery optimization or simulation use case—the input data could include:
- Numerical arrays representing physical parameters or time series (e.g., charge/discharge cycles, voltages, currents)
- Structured data relevant to quantum optimization or simulation (e.g., QUBO matrices, Hamiltonian parameters)
- Problem-specific values encoded according to the InputData schema you define for your service

You can describe the schema for your input data in the API specification under components.schemas.InputData, and PlanQK supports using Pydantic models in Python for type-safe data handling [doc1][doc2].

28;What kind of data preprocessing is required before passing text to the quantum model?;"Great question! On PlanQK, the type of data preprocessing required before passing text to a quantum model depends on the specific service or quantum algorithm you intend to use.

In general, quantum models and services on PlanQK expect input data in a structured format—most commonly as JSON objects. For text-based tasks (e.g., NLP or classification), you’ll need to ensure:

- Your text data is encoded as part of the input data schema defined for the service.
- The JSON payload should map your raw text or any derived features to the expected keys (e.g., ""text"", ""values"", etc.).
- If your quantum model expects numeric or vectorized representations (such as embeddings), you may need to preprocess your text (e.g., tokenization, encoding, vectorization) before submitting it. This preprocessing is typically done client-side, and the resulting vectors are then passed in the JSON input.
- Input data passed by value is limited to 1MB per request. For larger datasets, use PlanQK’s data pools and reference the file in your request rather than sending raw data directly [doc3].

Example JSON input for a service might look like:
```json
{
  ""data"": {
    ""text"": ""Your example sentence here""
  },
  ""params"": {
    ""some_parameter"": true
  }
}
```
Or, if your service expects embeddings:
```json
{
  ""data"": {
    ""values"": [0.123, 0.456, ...]
  },
  ""params"": { ... }
}
```

Always check the API specification for the specific service you are using on PlanQK to see the exact input schema and any required preprocessing steps [doc9].

When you design a quantum optimization problem (for example, scheduling, workforce assignment, or resource allocation), you can encode various constraints directly into the problem formulation.

Custom constraints (like vacation days and role qualifications) are typically represented as logical conditions or cost terms within your model. For instance:

- Vacation days: You can add a constraint that prevents assignment of tasks to individuals during their vacation periods.
- Role qualifications: You can restrict assignments so only qualified personnel are mapped to specific roles.

To implement these, you would:
1. Encode your constraints in the problem definition (e.g., as penalty terms in a QUBO or via constraint logic in a quantum circuit).
2. Pass the relevant input data and parameters (such as employee availability and qualification matrices) via the PlanQK Service API using the data and params fields in your JSON payload [doc6].
3. Use the PLANQK SDK or generated API clients for integration and testing [doc9].

If you’re building a custom service or algorithm, you can leverage the PlanQK platform to set up your own input structure and ensure these constraints are properly handled. You may also use the Workflow Editor for orchestrating multiple service calls, which allows you to preprocess or postprocess constraints as needed [doc10].

Would you like guidance on how to encode these constraints in a specific quantum algorithm or see example code for integrating such input with PlanQK?

37;Can external factors like weather forecasts or occupancy be included in the optimization?;"Yes, external factors such as weather forecasts and occupancy can absolutely be included in optimization problems on PlanQK. When designing an optimization service or workflow, you can structure your input data and parameters to reflect these external influences.

For example, in the OpenAPI schema for service inputs, you can define custom fields to encode weather data (temperature, humidity, forecasted precipitation, etc.) or occupancy levels (number of people, occupancy schedules, etc.)[doc8]. These external variables can then be used by your optimization algorithm—whether it’s quantum or classical—to adjust constraints, objectives, or parameters dynamically.

You would typically:
- Extend your input data schema to include relevant external factors.
- Ensure your optimization code or model logic utilizes these fields in its computations.
- If orchestrating multiple services, use PlanQK’s workflow tools to transform and route weather and occupancy data between nodes, as illustrated in orchestration examples.

39;Which dataset and features are typically used in fraud detection quantum models?;"Quantum fraud detection models, much like classical approaches, generally use datasets containing transactional records—such as credit card transactions, bank transfers, or e-commerce payment logs. The features (input variables) commonly extracted from these datasets include:

- Transaction amount
- Timestamp/date of transaction
- Merchant/category codes
- Geolocation data (country, city, IP address)
- User/customer identifiers
- Historical transaction patterns
- Device or channel information (mobile, web, POS)
- Frequency or velocity features (e.g., number of transactions in a short period)
- Behavioral features (changes in typical spending, login patterns)
- Previous fraud labels (if available, for supervised learning)

In quantum models, these features might be encoded using amplitude encoding, basis encoding, or other quantum-inspired techniques to leverage the power of quantum computing for anomaly detection, clustering, or classification tasks.
