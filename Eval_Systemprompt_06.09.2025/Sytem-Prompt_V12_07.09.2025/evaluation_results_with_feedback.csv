We are looking for a way to efficiently solving​
the challenges in providing sufficient airspace capacity to avoid airspace congestion. ";"Great to connect! Airspace capacity optimization and congestion avoidance are classic cases for advanced optimization and AI, and quantum computing can open new possibilities for complex scenarios like yours.

On PlanQK, you can leverage quantum-accelerated and classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization, scheduling, and resource allocation problems. For airspace management, this could mean:

- Quantum optimization for route planning, slot allocation, or sector balancing.
- AI-based predictive analytics to forecast congestion or dynamically re-route aircraft.
- Hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques for large-scale, real-time decision support.

Here’s how you can get started:

1. Explore Managed Services: These allow you to run quantum optimization code on-demand (no infrastructure management needed). You can deploy custom models, use templates, or try existing solutions for scheduling and optimization challenges. Services are accessible via standard HTTP APIs, so integration with your existing systems is straightforward.
   source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed

2. Use Starter Templates: Quickly prototype with Python or Docker-based templates tailored for quantum providers. The CLI makes it easy to package, test, and deploy your solution.
   source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction

3. Integrate with Classical and Quantum Backends: If you have existing data pipelines or optimization routines, PlanQK’s SDKs and service APIs let you orchestrate hybrid workflows and access quantum hardware from IBM, D-Wave, AWS Braket, and others.
   source: https://platform.planqk.de/sdk-reference

4. Secure & Scalable Integration: Applications on PlanQK use secure key-based authentication, and you can manage access tokens for your team or organization.
   source: https://platform.planqk.de/services/applications

Would you like to see a demo, or get support in mapping your airspace capacity challenges to a quantum optimization model? Can you share more details about the data and constraints you’re working with (e.g., number of sectors, traffic patterns, regulatory requirements)? This will help me recommend the most relevant service or solution.

2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends by using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and allows seamless integration with all quantum hardware and simulators supported by the PlanQK platform. Here’s how you can get started:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK  
Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher, then install the SDK via pip:
```bash
pip install planqk-quantum
```
source: https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-qiskit-with-planqk-sdk.html

2. Get Your Access Token  
Log in to your PlanQK account and generate an access token in your user settings. This token authenticates your requests and tracks usage costs.

3. Update Your Qiskit Code  
Import the PlanqkQuantumProvider in your code and pass your access token:
```python
from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider

planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
```

4. Select and Run on a Backend  
List available backends and select one (e.g., Azure IonQ simulator):
```python
backends = provider.backends()
backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
```
Then, transpile and run your circuit:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)
circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))

circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
```
source: https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-qiskit-with-planqk-sdk.html

Notes:
- If running inside a PlanQK Service, the access token is automatically set, so you don’t need to provide it.
- Execution costs depend on the selected backend and number of shots; see the pricing page for details.

12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To check whether your model processes the provided data correctly in PlanQK, you should follow these steps:

1. Submit your service execution by making a POST request to the service API, passing your input data and parameters. The input should be provided as a JSON object under ""data"" and ""params"" fields. For example:
```json
{
  ""data"": { ""values"": [1, 2, 3] },
  ""params"": { ""round_up"": true }
}
```
docs.planqk.de_services_managed_runtime-interface.html.json, docs.planqk.de_services_managed_openapi.html.json

2. After submitting, you can check the status of your execution by polling the status endpoint:
```bash
GET /{id}
```
This will tell you if your job is RUNNING, PENDING, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED. If the status is SUCCEEDED, your model has processed the data and completed execution.
docs.planqk.de_services_using-a-service.html.json

3. Retrieve and inspect the result using:
```bash
GET /{id}/result
```
The response will contain the processed output. For example:
```json
{
  ""result"": { ""sum"": 6 }
}
```
If the result matches your expectations based on the input, your model is processing data correctly. If not, check for error messages in the response for troubleshooting.
docs.planqk.de_services_using-a-service.html.json

4. For larger datasets, consider using Data Pools to manage input and output data efficiently, allowing you to share and review job results with collaborators.

15;How can I limit resource usage during service setup to stay within budget?;"To control resource usage and stay within budget during service setup on PlanQK, you should configure resource limits when defining your service. PlanQK allows you to specify the number of virtual CPU cores, amount of memory (in GB), and—if needed—the GPU configuration for your service. By setting these limits according to your budget and expected workload, you can prevent excessive resource consumption and manage costs effectively.

Here’s how you can do it:

- When setting up or configuring your service, look for the Resource Configuration section.
- Define:
  - Number of virtual CPU cores
  - Amount of memory in GB
  - (Optional) GPU configuration
- These values determine the maximum resources allocated to your service at runtime, so setting lower values will help keep costs down.
- You can adjust these settings later if you need to optimize further.

For step-by-step guidance and more information, visit the Managed Services introduction: source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html

17;Is it possible to compare two services in terms of efficiency and runtime?;"Yes, you can compare two services on PlanQK in terms of efficiency and runtime, but the process is not fully automated—you’ll need to design and execute your own benchmarks using each service’s API. Here’s how you can approach it technically:

- Both services expose asynchronous HTTP APIs, allowing you to submit jobs and poll for their execution status and results. This is especially useful for long-running jobs, as you avoid client timeouts and can monitor actual runtimes directly via the status endpoints. By measuring the time taken from job submission to completion, you can reliably compare runtimes between services for identical tasks or datasets. Efficiency can be assessed by comparing resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, GPU) and result quality, which are often configurable via the service API payloads and planqk.json settings. For example, you may allocate more or less compute resources per service and observe the impact on runtime and result quality (docs.planqk.de_services_managed_runtime-interface.html.json, docs.planqk.de_planqk-json-reference.html.json).

- To do a fair comparison, ensure you use the same input payloads (data and params), run identical tasks, and consistently poll for status/results. You can automate this process using scripts or Jupyter notebooks, as shown in PlanQK sample repositories. Also, you can use the resource configuration in planqk.json to set identical hardware profiles for both services if possible.

27;Which types of input data were used to train the quantum model in this battery case?;"For PlanQK managed services (such as quantum models used in battery use cases), the input data types are typically defined through schemas that specify the structure and type of data the model expects. For example, a service might expect input data representing numerical values in an array, such as battery parameters, sensor readings, or other relevant features for quantum model training. The input schema might look like this:

- values: List of numbers (e.g., battery measurements or feature vectors)
- Additional parameters: Boolean flags or other settings (such as round_up) to influence the evaluation or model behavior

In general, the input data should encode the actual problem information (e.g., physical quantities, material properties, or simulation results relevant to battery modeling), while input parameters provide extra options for the model evaluation (e.g., quantum circuit parameters, optimization settings).

The input is typically provided as a JSON object with ""data"" containing the actual values and ""params"" for additional settings. For instance:

{
  ""data"": {
    ""values"": [1, 2, 3]  // Replace with battery-relevant features
  },
  ""params"": {
    ""round_up"": true      // Example of an additional parameter
  }
}

These schemas can be customized for your specific battery case to include relevant types and structures, such as arrays of floats for physical measurements or categorical data for material types. For more details on defining and using input data types, see the documentation here: docs.planqk.de_services_managed_openapi.html.json, docs.planqk.de_services_managed_runtime-interface.html.json.

28;What kind of data preprocessing is required before passing text to the quantum model?;"For most PlanQK quantum and AI services, especially those that process text data, the required data preprocessing is determined by the input data schema specified in the service's API description. Here’s how you should approach preprocessing:

- Structure your input as a JSON object, since PlanQK services currently only support JSON input for service execution. This means your text data should be organized into key-value pairs according to the schema defined by the service, for example:
  ```json
  {
    ""data"": {
      ""text"": ""Your input string here""
    },
    ""params"": {
      // any additional parameters required by the model
    }
  }
  ```
- Check the specific service documentation to see if the input schema requires lists, strings, or other data types. For text, common requirements are:
  - Removing extra whitespace
  - Lowercasing (if required)
  - Tokenization (if the model expects a list of tokens)
  - Encoding (some quantum NLP services may require numerical or binary encoding)
- Input data should not exceed 1MB if passed directly; for larger datasets, use the PlanQK data pool feature to reference files instead of sending raw data.

Next steps:
- Review the API specification for your chosen quantum model/service to see the exact input requirements.
- Preprocess your text according to those requirements and structure it as a JSON payload.
- If needed, leverage data pools for larger or reusable datasets.

33;Can the quantum model handle custom constraints like vacation days and role qualifications?;"Yes, you can incorporate custom constraints such as vacation days and role qualifications when building quantum or AI models on PlanQK. The platform is designed to support flexible input data and parameters, allowing you to encode problem-specific constraints directly in your service implementation.

When you set up a PLANQK Service, you provide input through a JSON object that can include any data structure you need. For example, you might include arrays or objects representing employee vacation schedules or required qualifications for roles. These can then be processed within your model's code to enforce the relevant constraints during optimization or scheduling tasks. The runtime interface passes these custom inputs to your run() method, so you can handle them however you wish, including using Pydantic models for structured validation and parsing of complex constraints like time-off or required skills.

Here's a technical example:  
- Input JSON might look like:
  ```json
  {
    ""data"": {
      ""employees"": [
        {""id"": 1, ""vacation_days"": [2024-06-10, 2024-06-11], ""qualifications"": [""quantum"", ""python""]},
        {""id"": 2, ""vacation_days"": [], ""qualifications"": [""ai"", ""optimization""]}
      ],
      ""roles"": [
        {""id"": ""analyst"", ""required_qualifications"": [""quantum""]},
        {""id"": ""developer"", ""required_qualifications"": [""python""]}
      ]
    },
    ""params"": {...}
  }
  ```
- Your run() method receives this data and can enforce vacation and qualification constraints within the quantum algorithm or classical logic.

If you need help encoding these constraints for a specific algorithm or use case (e.g., workforce scheduling, resource allocation), PlanQK offers numerous starter templates and workflow orchestration tools to streamline the integration of such business rules.

34;What kind of model is used to classify cancerous cells in this use case?;"Based on the information available, there is no specific reference to a model used for classifying cancerous cells in the retrieved PlanQK documentation. The documents primarily discuss how to create use cases, describe details, link algorithms, and deploy services or demos on PlanQK, but they do not mention any particular machine learning or quantum model for cancer cell classification.

If you're interested in building or exploring such a use case, PlanQK enables users to document industrial use cases, link relevant algorithms (including those for classification tasks), and deploy services using various computational backends. You can elaborate the problem statement, link your classification algorithms (classical or quantum), and even deploy interactive demos for your solution. For a cancer cell classification task, you would typically describe the use case, attach the implementation (for example, a quantum-enhanced machine learning model), and provide details about the underlying algorithm in the ""Relations"" section of the use case editor.

If you have a specific algorithm or model in mind (e.g., quantum neural network, SVM, etc.), I can guide you on how to document and link it within PlanQK, or how to deploy a demo for it. Are you looking for guidance on documenting a new use case, or do you want to know what existing models are available on PlanQK for this application?

35;We want to reduce hospital readmission rates. Can quantum machine learning help us identify high-risk patients?;"Absolutely—quantum machine learning (QML) has promising potential to enhance predictive analytics in healthcare, especially for complex tasks like identifying patients at high risk of hospital readmission. Quantum algorithms can process and analyze large, multidimensional datasets more efficiently than some classical approaches, potentially uncovering patterns that help anticipate readmissions earlier and more accurately.

On PlanQK, you have access to both quantum and classical machine learning frameworks, allowing you to experiment with QML models for healthcare use cases. You could, for example, develop models using Qiskit or Amazon Braket SDKs, both of which are supported on the platform. Additionally, PlanQK provides starter templates and managed services that make it easy to set up interactive demos and machine learning applications, so you can rapidly prototype and test your ideas with real hospital data (de-identified and GDPR-compliant, of course) before scaling up for production use.

Here’s how you might proceed:

- Start with a classical ML baseline: Use PlanQK's managed service templates to build a prediction model for readmission risk.
- Explore QML: Use the Quantum SDK (supports Qiskit, Amazon Braket, and even PennyLane for quantum ML algorithms) to adapt your model and compare performance.
- Deploy and demo: Use PlanQK’s Gradio starter or Docker-based demo templates to create interactive web apps for stakeholders, showcasing the predictive insights.
- Automate and scale: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous model improvement and deployment.

36;We manage a portfolio of smart buildings. Can quantum computing help optimize heating and cooling schedules to reduce energy consumption?;"Absolutely! Quantum computing can offer significant advantages for optimizing heating and cooling schedules in smart buildings, especially when dealing with complex scenarios involving many variables and constraints.

Quantum optimization algorithms—such as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing—are particularly well-suited for tackling large-scale scheduling and resource allocation problems. These methods can potentially find more efficient solutions than classical approaches, leading to reduced energy consumption and operational costs.

The PlanQK platform provides ready-to-use services and SDKs that let you model and solve such optimization challenges using quantum backends. For example, you can use quantum annealing devices (such as those from D-Wave) to solve scheduling problems formulated as QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) models. There are tutorials and sample code to help you get started with running optimization tasks on quantum hardware or simulators, and you can even orchestrate workflows that combine quantum and classical services for hybrid solutions.

To explore further:

37;Can external factors like weather forecasts or occupancy be included in the optimization?;"Yes, you can include external factors such as weather forecasts or occupancy data in your optimization use case within PlanQK. When creating a new use case, the Details section allows you to exhaustively describe the problem and its mathematical subproblems—including how external data sources can be mapped onto quantum hardware or classical algorithms. You can also link relevant data pools (such as weather or occupancy datasets) in the Relations tab, so associated services and algorithms can access them for your optimization scenario. This makes it straightforward to model and solve problems that depend on external variables by integrating these data sources into your workflow or service logic.

If you need to orchestrate services that combine multiple data streams (like weather and occupancy) for optimization, the Workflow Editor lets you define data nodes and connections, so you can transform and route these inputs to your algorithms as needed. Would you like specific guidance on connecting external data pools, or examples of how to configure your workflow for this purpose?

38;What is the goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule on a quantum computer?;"The goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule (H₂) on a quantum computer is to demonstrate how quantum algorithms can solve problems in quantum chemistry that are computationally challenging for classical computers. Specifically, quantum simulation aims to compute the ground state energy and electronic structure of molecules, which is essential for understanding chemical reactions and material properties.

Hydrogen is often chosen as the starting example because it's the simplest molecule with two protons and two electrons, making it a practical benchmark for testing quantum algorithms like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) or Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). Successfully simulating H₂ validates the capability of quantum computers to address more complex molecules and reactions in the future, potentially revolutionizing fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and catalysis.

39;Which dataset and features are typically used in fraud detection quantum models?;"Quantum models for fraud detection typically use datasets containing transactional records, such as credit card transactions, bank payments, or insurance claims. The features extracted from these datasets often include:

- Transaction amount
- Time and date of transaction
- Location (e.g., merchant city, country)
- Merchant category
- User account details
- Historical transaction patterns
- Device/browser information
- Frequency or velocity of transactions
- Flags for unusual activity (e.g., large amounts, foreign locations)
- Account relationships (e.g., network features or graph-based attributes)

These features are selected to help identify anomalous behaviors or patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. In quantum machine learning models, these features are typically preprocessed and encoded into quantum circuits using techniques like amplitude encoding or basis encoding, which allow the quantum algorithm to process high-dimensional data efficiently.

If you’re interested in implementing or experimenting with quantum fraud detection on PlanQK, I recommend starting by identifying a representative transactional dataset and determining the most relevant features for your fraud scenario. PlanQK offers starter templates and workflow tools that can help you build and orchestrate such models using quantum SDKs and managed services. You can also explore existing use cases and tutorials for practical guidance:

40;What features are used to train the quantum model in the readmission prediction task?;"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of features used for training a quantum model in a readmission prediction task. The documentation focuses primarily on how to structure input data and parameters for PlanQK services, including examples such as summing lists of numbers or configuring service jobs, but does not describe feature engineering or domain-specific modeling for healthcare or readmission prediction.

If you're looking to implement a readmission prediction task using quantum machine learning on PlanQK, you would generally need to:

- Encode input features relevant to patient readmission, such as demographics, clinical history, lab results, admission/discharge details, etc., into the data section of the service input.
- Define any parameters that control the quantum model's behavior (e.g., number of qubits, training epochs) within the params section.
- Structure your service so that the run() method accepts this input and processes it using your quantum algorithm.

Would you like guidance on how to map typical healthcare features into a PlanQK service input format, or do you have a specific model or quantum algorithm in mind for the readmission prediction task?
