2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK’s quantum backends by using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and maintains the same functionality and syntax as the original Qiskit SDK [doc1]. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install PLANQK Quantum SDK**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher. Install the SDK via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install planqk-quantum
   ```
   [doc1]

2. **Get Your Access Token**  
   Log in to the PLANQK platform and copy your personal quantum access token from your user settings. This token authenticates your requests and tracks usage costs [doc1].

3. **Set Up Your Provider**  
   In your Qiskit code, import the provider and pass your access token:
   ```python
   from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
   planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
   provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
   ```
   If you’re running your code inside a PLANQK service, the token is managed automatically [doc1][doc2].

4. **Select and List Backends**  
   List available quantum backends and choose the one you want:
   ```python
   backends = provider.backends()
   backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")  # Example backend
   ```
   [doc2]

5. **Run Your Qiskit Circuit**  
   Write and transpile your Qiskit circuit, then execute it on the selected backend:
   ```python
   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

   circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
   circuit.h(0)
   circuit.cx(0, 1)
   circuit.cx(1, 2)
   circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))

   circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
   job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
   result = job.result()
   ```
   You can retrieve results, cancel jobs, and manage executions as usual [doc2].

6. **Check Backend Costs**  
   Note that running circuits may incur costs depending on the backend and number of shots. Check the pricing page for details [doc2].

12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To check whether your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should follow these steps:

1. **Test Locally Using Input Files**  
Prepare your input data and parameters as JSON files according to your expected input structure. For example, if your service expects input in the format { ""data"": { ... }, ""params"": { ... } }, create input/data.json and input/params.json files reflecting this structure. You can run your service locally in a Docker container and mount these input files into the container for testing. Any output generated will be available in the out directory after the container finishes running [doc10].

2. **Run Locally with PLANQK CLI**  
You can use the PLANQK CLI to run your service locally using the planqk serve command, which exposes the same HTTP endpoints as PLANQK. This allows you to start a service execution, check the status, and retrieve results locally, simulating how PLANQK would process your data [doc6].

3. **Check Output Structure**  
Ensure the output of your run() method is a JSON-serializable object, such as a dictionary or a Pydantic model. PLANQK will serialize this output and return it in the response body of the result endpoint. For example, if your run() method returns { ""sum"": 6 }, you should check that the output JSON matches the expected format [doc3].

4. **Inspect Output Files**  
If your service writes files to /var/runtime/output, these files are treated as part of the service output. After running your container, inspect the out directory for any generated files to verify correctness [doc10].

Would you like detailed steps for setting up a test scenario with your specific model, or do you need guidance on interpreting the output? If you share your model’s expected input and output formats, I can help you design a targeted test.";Use job monitoring features to inspect logs and outputs to validate correct data usage.;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.6666666666666667;The generated answer provides a detailed and relevant approach to checking if a model processes data correctly, specifically in the context of using PlanQK.

The generated answer could be improved by including more general advice applicable to any model, not just those on PlanQK.;YES;YES
13;Can I test a service without having programming knowledge?;"Yes, you can test a service on PlanQK without deep programming knowledge! The platform is designed to be accessible to different user skill levels. Here’s how you can do it:

- You can use the provided input folder in your service project to supply test data and parameters locally, even without writing code. For example, if your service expects input in JSON format, you can create a file like data.json and place it in the input directory for testing purposes. When you run your Docker container, the platform will handle input and output files, making it straightforward to see results without manual scripting [doc1].
- For executing services on the platform, PlanQK offers a web interface where you can subscribe to services and trigger executions through simple forms—no code required. You just need to provide the required input data (typically in JSON) and parameters using guided dialogs. You can also reuse datasets from the data pool by selecting files through the UI [doc10].
- If you prefer not to handle JSON directly, consider using marketplace services that often provide more user-friendly interfaces. You can navigate, subscribe, and run services with guided steps through the PlanQK dashboard .

14;What permissions do team members have based on their role in an organization?;"Team members in a PlanQK organization can be assigned one of several roles, each with distinct permissions:

- Viewer: Can see the content of the organization but cannot edit or create content.
- Maintainer: Can create new content and edit existing content, but cannot delete content.
- Owner: Can create, edit, and delete all content within the organization. Owners can also add new members, assign them different roles, delete members, and edit the organization profile.

When a member is added to an organization, they receive an email invitation that must be confirmed before gaining access. Owners have the highest level of control, including member and content management, while maintainers and viewers have more limited capabilities tailored to collaboration and oversight needs[doc4].";"Roles like ""Owner"", ""Maintainer"", and ""Viewer"" grant different levels of access and editing rights.";5.0;1.0;1.0;2.3333333333333335;The generated answer is relevant and fully correct. It provides a detailed explanation of the permissions associated with each role within an organization, aligning well with the user query. The answer expands on the reference answer by specifying the permissions for each role and adding additional context about the process of adding members and the responsibilities of each role.;YES;YES
15;How can I limit resource usage during service setup to stay within budget?;"To limit resource usage during service setup on PlanQK and stay within budget, you should configure the resource allocation in your service definition. When creating or updating your service, you can specify the number of virtual CPU cores, the amount of memory (in GB), and, if needed, the GPU type and count. These settings are defined in the planqk.json file and can be set via the PLANQK CLI. For example, you might set lower values for cpu and memory to minimize costs:

{
  ""resources"": {
    ""cpu"": 1,
    ""memory"": 2
  }
}

If you need GPU resources, you can also specify the type (NVIDIA_TESLA_T4 or NVIDIA_TESLA_V100) and count, but only include them if necessary for your workloads. Adjust these values based on your expected service usage and performance needs. This approach ensures your service consumes only the resources you allocate, helping you stay within your budget limits [doc9].

However, it is more detailed than the reference answer, which might not be necessary for all users.;YES;YES
17;Is it possible to compare two services in terms of efficiency and runtime?;"Yes, you can compare two PLANQK services in terms of efficiency and runtime, but the process is somewhat manual and depends on how you structure your testing and measurement.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Service Execution & Monitoring:** Each PLANQK service provides an asynchronous execution model. You start a service execution via its API, then poll for status and results. This design helps you track how long each service takes to complete, especially for long-running tasks like quantum circuit training or optimization. By recording timestamps when you submit and when you receive results, you can calculate the runtime for each service [doc2][doc10].

2. **Input Consistency:** To compare efficiency fairly, make sure you provide identical (or equivalently scaled) input data and parameters to both services. Inputs are provided as JSON objects in the { ""data"": ..., ""params"": ... } format via the service API [doc2][doc9].

3. **Resource Configuration:** Service efficiency may depend on allocated resources (CPU, memory, GPU). These are specified in the planqk.json configuration for each service. You can review or set resource allocations to ensure a fair comparison [doc6].

28;What kind of data preprocessing is required before passing text to the quantum model?;"There isn’t a universal preprocessing requirement enforced by PlanQK for text data before passing it to a quantum model—what’s required depends on the specific service or quantum algorithm you are using. However, here are some general guidelines and actionable steps based on PlanQK’s managed service input handling:

- Input Format: All service inputs must be JSON-serializable. This means you should convert your text data into a suitable JSON structure, such as a list, string, or dictionary, depending on what the quantum model expects. For example, if your model expects a list of sentences, you would provide: { ""values"": [""sentence 1"", ""sentence 2"", ...] } [doc1].
- Size Limit: Direct JSON input is limited to 1MB. For larger datasets, use the PlanQK Data Pool feature, which lets you reference files by ID rather than passing large data inline [doc3].
- Data Encoding: If your quantum model requires numerical encoding (e.g., embeddings, token IDs), you may need to preprocess your text using classical NLP techniques (tokenization, vectorization, etc.) before submitting it as input data. The exact format should be defined in the service's API schema [doc1].
- Input Data vs. Input Parameters: Input data encodes the actual information (e.g., the text or its embeddings), while input parameters are used to influence execution (e.g., setting model options or quantum backend choices) [doc1].

To proceed, check the API specification of the quantum model service you want to use for the exact input schema and preprocessing expectations. You can view or edit these schemas in the service details using the integrated Swagger Editor on PlanQK [doc9].

38;What is the goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule on a quantum computer?;"The goal of simulating the hydrogen molecule on a quantum computer is to demonstrate quantum simulation techniques for solving problems in quantum chemistry—specifically, to calculate properties such as the molecule's ground state energy. Hydrogen (H₂) is the simplest molecule and serves as a foundational test case for quantum algorithms in chemistry. By simulating H₂, researchers can benchmark quantum hardware and algorithms, and validate approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) or Quantum Phase Estimation before tackling more complex molecules. This helps pave the way for quantum computing applications in material science, drug discovery, and chemical reaction modeling.

Are you interested in running such a simulation on PlanQK, or learning about available quantum chemistry services on the platform?";Uses VQE to calculate the ground state energy of H₂.;5.0;1.0;1.0;2.3333333333333335;The generated answer is highly relevant and correct.

39;Which dataset and features are typically used in fraud detection quantum models?;"PlanQK documentation does not specify a particular dataset or list of features that are universally used for fraud detection quantum models. Typically, in classical and quantum machine learning for fraud detection, datasets include transaction records with features such as transaction amount, time, location, merchant, user ID, device information, and behavioral patterns. Quantum models may leverage these features by encoding them into quantum states for processing on quantum hardware.

If you're looking to build or explore a fraud detection use case on PlanQK, you can start by describing your dataset and features in the ""Details"" section of a use case. This section allows you to elaborate on how you map your initial problem statement (fraud detection) to the relevant mathematical subproblem suitable for quantum hardware. You can also include information about the features you intend to use, application areas, and link relevant algorithms or quantum services within your use case documentation. Additionally, you can reference available data pools or quantum apps associated with your use case in the ""Relations"" section for further context and resources[source: https://docs.planqk.de/community/use-cases.html][doc5].
