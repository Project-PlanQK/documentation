12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To verify whether your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should follow these steps:

1. Use the planqk serve command locally to run your project in a containerized environment. This simulates how PLANQK would execute your code and exposes the same HTTP endpoints for service execution, status checking, cancellation, and result retrieval. This allows you to send test requests to your model and inspect its behavior and output in a controlled environment before deploying it on the platform [doc9].

2. Provide input data in the expected JSON format. The PlanQK runtime expects input as a JSON object with ""data"" and ""params"" fields, which are passed as arguments to your run() method. You can define your input as raw dictionaries or Pydantic models and check if your model handles them as intended [doc3].

3. After executing your model, examine the output returned by your run() method. The result is returned as a JSON-serializable object, which you can inspect to ensure correctness. If you return a dictionary, PlanQK automatically serializes it for the API response [doc3].

4. Optionally, you can use the planqk run CLI command to execute your service with specific input data and parameters, either directly as JSON strings or from files, and review the returned results [doc9].

By running these tests locally and checking the returned outputs, you can confirm that your model processes input data as expected before deploying it to the PlanQK platform.
