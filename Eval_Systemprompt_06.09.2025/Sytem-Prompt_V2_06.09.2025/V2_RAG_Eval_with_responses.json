      "response": "Thank you for outlining your challenge regarding airspace capacity and congestion. PlanQK provides solutions for complex optimization and analytics problems using quantum and classical approaches. Based on your description, you may benefit from managed quantum services, which allow you to focus on developing your optimization algorithms in Python or other supported languages while PlanQK handles the infrastructure, deployment, and scaling of your solution. This can be particularly valuable for problems like airspace capacity, which often involve large-scale optimization and scheduling.\n\nTo get started, you can:\n- Use managed services to deploy your quantum or classical optimization code on PlanQK without managing infrastructure. Your code can be containerized and executed on-demand, and results can be retrieved asynchronously. You can share your service internally or externally using standard HTTP APIs source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html.\n- Create your service using the PlanQK CLI or the platform UI. The CLI provides starter templates (including ones tailored for specific quantum providers) and streamlines packaging and deployment. The README.md in your project will guide you through local testing and deployment steps source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html.\n- Integrate with PlanQK's workflow orchestration tools to automate and chain optimization tasks, leveraging the Workflow Editor that supports BPMN-standard workflows for complex process management source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/orchestration/workflow-editor.html.\n\nFor your airspace congestion challenge, you might consider formulating the problem as a scheduling or routing optimization and deploying it as a managed service. If you require specialized backends or need to leverage quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization, PlanQK supports integration with leading quantum hardware platforms (such as AWS Braket, D-Wave, IBM Quantum) via its Quantum SDK source: https://docs.planqk.de/sdk-reference.html.\n\nTo tailor recommendations further:\n- Could you specify if you already have an optimization algorithm or model in mind?\n- Do you intend to use classical, quantum, or hybrid approaches?\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?"
