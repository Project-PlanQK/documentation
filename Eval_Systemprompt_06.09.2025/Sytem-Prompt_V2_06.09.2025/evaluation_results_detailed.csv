1;"I am a tech lead at Lufhansa consulting. ​
We are looking for a way to efficiently solving​
the challenges in providing sufficient airspace capacity to avoid airspace congestion. ";"Thank you for outlining your challenge regarding airspace capacity and congestion. PlanQK provides solutions for complex optimization and analytics problems using quantum and classical approaches. Based on your description, you may benefit from managed quantum services, which allow you to focus on developing your optimization algorithms in Python or other supported languages while PlanQK handles the infrastructure, deployment, and scaling of your solution. This can be particularly valuable for problems like airspace capacity, which often involve large-scale optimization and scheduling.

To get started, you can:
- Use managed services to deploy your quantum or classical optimization code on PlanQK without managing infrastructure. Your code can be containerized and executed on-demand, and results can be retrieved asynchronously. You can share your service internally or externally using standard HTTP APIs source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html.
- Create your service using the PlanQK CLI or the platform UI. The CLI provides starter templates (including ones tailored for specific quantum providers) and streamlines packaging and deployment. The README.md in your project will guide you through local testing and deployment steps source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html.
- Integrate with PlanQK's workflow orchestration tools to automate and chain optimization tasks, leveraging the Workflow Editor that supports BPMN-standard workflows for complex process management source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/orchestration/workflow-editor.html.

For your airspace congestion challenge, you might consider formulating the problem as a scheduling or routing optimization and deploying it as a managed service. If you require specialized backends or need to leverage quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization, PlanQK supports integration with leading quantum hardware platforms (such as AWS Braket, D-Wave, IBM Quantum) via its Quantum SDK source: https://docs.planqk.de/sdk-reference.html.

To tailor recommendations further:
- Could you specify if you already have an optimization algorithm or model in mind?
- Do you intend to use classical, quantum, or hybrid approaches?

2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"You can run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends by using the PLANQK Quantum SDK, which acts as a wrapper for Qiskit and provides the same functionality and syntax. Here’s how to get started:

1. Install the PLANQK Quantum SDK:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher.
   - Install the SDK via pip:
     ```
     pip install planqk-quantum
     ```
   source: https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-qiskit-with-planqk-sdk.html

2. Obtain an Access Token:
   - Log in to your PLANQK account and copy your personal quantum access token.
   - This token authenticates your requests and tracks quantum usage costs.
   - If running in a PLANQK service, the token is set automatically by the platform.
   source: https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-qiskit-with-planqk-sdk.html

3. Select and Execute on a Quantum Backend:
   - Import the provider and pass your token (unless running in a service):
     ```python
     from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
     planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
     provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
     ```
   - List available backends and select one, for example:
     ```python
     backends = provider.backends()
     backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
     ```
   - Execute your Qiskit circuit:
     ```python
     from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
     circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
     circuit.h(0)
     circuit.cx(0, 1)
     circuit.cx(1, 2)
     circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
     circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
     job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
     ```
   source: https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-qiskit-with-planqk-sdk.html

You can use the SDK directly in your IDE or as part of a PLANQK service. Please note that execution costs may apply depending on your chosen backend and number of shots.

Is there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?";Use the PlanqkQuantumProviderfrom the PlanQK Quantum SDK to run your Qiskit code on supported quantum backends.;5.0;1.0;1.0;2.3333333333333335
3;How do I authenticate with the PlanQK SDK to run quantum programs?;"To authenticate with the PlanQK SDK for running quantum programs, you need a valid PlanQK account and a quantum access token. This token is used to authenticate your requests and track usage costs. You can log in to the PlanQK platform and copy your personal access token from your user settings. Optionally, you may generate dedicated access tokens for use in your quantum code.

The access token can be set in your code when initializing the PlanqkQuantumProvider object. If your code is executed within a PlanQK service, the platform automatically sets the access token, so you can omit the access_token parameter. If you do set it, it will be replaced by the service token.

Example usage in Python:
```python
from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
```

12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To verify that your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should follow these steps:

1. Make sure your service accepts input in the expected format (typically a JSON object with ""data"" and ""params"" keys). For example:
```json
{
  ""data"": { ""values"": [1, 2, 3] },
  ""params"": { ""round_up"": true }
}
```
This input will be passed as arguments to your run() method in your service implementation source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/runtime-interface.html.

2. Locally test your service using the PLANQK CLI or by running your Docker container. You can use input files (e.g., data.json and params.json) that match your expected input structure. For Docker-based services, mount the input directory to /var/runtime/input and check the output in /var/runtime/output after execution source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/custom-containers.html.

3. Use the planqk serve command to run your service in a local containerized environment. The local web server will expose the same HTTP endpoints as on PLANQK, allowing you to submit test data and retrieve results source: https://docs.planqk.de/cli-reference.html.

4. Inspect the output returned by your run() method. The result should be a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a dictionary) and will be available at the result endpoint. For example, if your method returns {""sum"": 6}, you should see this in the HTTP response source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/runtime-interface.html.

By following these steps, you can validate whether your model correctly processes the provided data before deploying on PlanQK.

15;How can I limit resource usage during service setup to stay within budget?;"To limit resource usage during service setup on PlanQK and help manage your budget, you can configure the allocated resources for your service. Specifically, you can define the number of virtual CPU cores and the amount of memory (in GB) to be allocated for your service at runtime. If you require GPU resources, you may also specify the GPU type and count. These configurations are set in the planqk.json file and can be adjusted to fit your resource and budget constraints.

Here’s an example configuration you might use in your planqk.json file:

{
  ""resources"": {
    ""cpu"": 1,           // Set to the minimum required CPU cores
    ""memory"": 2,        // Set to the minimum required memory in GB
    ""gpu"": {
      ""type"": ""NVIDIA_TESLA_T4"",
      ""count"": 0        // Omit or set to zero if no GPU is needed
    }
  }
}

Adjust these values according to your needs to avoid unnecessary resource allocation and to control costs. You can update these settings before deployment or modify them later if your requirements change source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html, source: https://docs.planqk.de/planqk-json-reference.html.
