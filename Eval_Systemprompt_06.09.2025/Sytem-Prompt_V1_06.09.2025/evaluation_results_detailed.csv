1;"I am a tech lead at Lufhansa consulting. ​
We are looking for a way to efficiently solving​
the challenges in providing sufficient airspace capacity to avoid airspace congestion. ";"Thank you for sharing your requirements. PLANQK provides tools and infrastructure to help address complex operational challenges using quantum and AI technologies, such as optimizing airspace capacity and reducing congestion.

To get started, could you clarify:
- What type of data do you have available (e.g., flight schedules, airspace usage patterns, weather)?
- Are you interested in exploring quantum algorithms, classical AI, or hybrid approaches for optimization?
- Is your team looking to prototype, run experiments, or deploy production solutions?

PLANQK offers Managed Services that let you run quantum code on-demand without managing your own infrastructure. You can focus on developing your optimization algorithms (in Python or other supported languages), while PLANQK handles deployment, scaling, and access via standard APIs. This can accelerate your experimentation and solution rollout for airspace capacity challenges. You can also leverage starter templates to rapidly build and deploy quantum solutions, and share them securely within your organization or with external partners via HTTP APIs [doc1][doc2].

Would you like guidance on setting up a workspace, connecting your data, or exploring relevant quantum optimization use cases within PLANQK?

2;How can I run my existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends?;"To run your existing Qiskit code on PlanQK's quantum backends, you should use the PLANQK Quantum SDK. This SDK wraps Qiskit, so you can use the same functionality and syntax as you would with standard Qiskit code. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Install PLANQK Quantum SDK:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher.
   - Install the SDK using pip:
     ```
     pip install planqk-quantum
     ```
   [doc1]

2. Obtain an Access Token:
   - Log in to PLANQK and copy your personal access token from your user settings.
   - This token is required to authenticate and track usage costs for quantum executions.
   [doc1]

3. Use the PlanqkQuantumProvider in your Qiskit code:
   - Import the provider and pass your access token:
     ```python
     from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
     planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
     provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
     ```
   - If running within a PLANQK service, the token is set automatically, so you can omit it.
   [doc1][doc2]

4. List and select available backends:
   ```python
   backends = provider.backends()
   backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")  # Example backend
   ```
   [doc2]

5. Prepare and execute your circuit:
   ```python
   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
   circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
   circuit.h(0)
   circuit.cx(0, 1)
   circuit.cx(1, 2)
   circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
   circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
   job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
   ```
   [doc2]

6. Retrieve results or manage jobs as needed.

Please note, running Qiskit code on PLANQK may incur execution costs depending on the backend and number of shots. You can find backend pricing details on the PlanQK pricing page [doc2].

3;How do I authenticate with the PlanQK SDK to run quantum programs?;"To authenticate with the PlanQK Quantum SDK and run quantum programs, you need to obtain a valid quantum access token from your PlanQK account. This token is used to authenticate your requests to the platform and track the usage costs associated with your executions. You can find your personal access token on the PlanQK welcome page, or generate dedicated access tokens in your user settings. Once you have the token, you pass it to the PlanqkQuantumProvider object in your code. If your code is executed within a PlanQK service, the access token is automatically set by the platform and the access_token parameter can be omitted, as it will be replaced by the service token [doc4].

4;How do I use the PlanQK CLI to manage my implementations?;"To manage your implementations using the PlanQK CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of the PLANQK CLI on your machine. You can find installation instructions in the CLI reference section of the documentation. The CLI requires Node.js 18 or higher and can be installed via npm: npm install -g @planqk/planqk-cli [doc2].

2. Initialize your project with the CLI. For example, to start a Docker Python project, run planqk init. When prompted, choose your project name, select a starter template (such as Docker Starter), and configure your resources as needed. This will create a new project folder with starter code and a README file [doc1].

3. To create a new implementation, visit the ""Create Implementation"" page on the platform, provide a name, and click ""Create"". Afterward, you can clone the repository to your local machine using a git clone command that includes your personal access token for authentication. You can find this command on your implementation page [doc4][doc6].

4. Add or update files in your local repository (e.g., add a README.md), then push your changes back to the PlanQK Git server using standard git commands [doc6].

5. Once your code is in the implementation, you can use the CLI to deploy and manage your service. The CLI will automatically generate a planqk.json file for your project, specifying the service configuration, resources, and runtime. To deploy, use the planqk up command; the serviceId will be added upon successful deployment [doc3].

6. After deployment, you can manage your service (such as updating code or configuration) through the CLI and the web interface. If your implementation includes a Dockerfile, you can create a managed service directly from the implementation page by clicking the ""Create Service"" button [doc1].

11;Can I reuse previously developed services for similar use cases?;"Yes, you can reuse previously developed services for similar use cases on PlanQK. The platform supports Service Orchestration, which allows you to build larger services by setting up workflows that call existing services in a defined order. You can use the results of one service as input for another, enabling you to compose and reuse services for various use cases without writing additional code. This orchestration is managed through a workflow editor and can be deployed and executed on a workflow engine like Camunda [doc5].

Is there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?";Yes, services can be stored, managed, and reused via the platform.;5.0;1.0;1.0;2.3333333333333335
12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To verify that your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you can use the available service endpoints to monitor and inspect the execution and results:

- When you send a request to run your service (using the POST / endpoint), you receive a service execution ID. You can then use the GET /{id} endpoint to check the execution status (e.g., PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED) and review timestamps for creation, start, and completion.
- To review the actual output of your model, use the GET /{id}/result endpoint. This returns the JSON result produced by your model, allowing you to inspect whether the output matches expectations. Additionally, you can download any result files associated with the execution.
- If you want to check the log output line by line, use GET /{id}/log. This can help you diagnose issues or confirm that the processing steps are executed as intended.
- If necessary, you can cancel a running or pending execution using PUT /{id}/cancel.

By leveraging these endpoints, you can systematically check if your model correctly processes the provided data and review both results and logs for confirmation or troubleshooting. Remember not to change the operation/endpoints, as this may disrupt proper communication with the service. A template for API description is also available to help you define expected input and output clearly source: https://platform.planqk.de/docs.planqk.de_services_managed_openapi.html.

13;Can I test a service without having programming knowledge?;"Yes, you can test a service on PlanQK without needing programming knowledge. The platform allows you to use the input folder in your project to provide input data and parameters for local testing. You simply need to prepare your input files (such as data.json) according to your expected JSON input structure. After building your Docker container, you can run it and any output written to /var/runtime/output will be available in the out directory once the container finishes running. This process does not require writing code, just organizing files and executing basic commands. For more details, you may refer to the runtime interface documentation for custom Docker containers and utilize the CLI or web application for deployment steps source: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/custom-containers.html.

Is there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?";Yes, services can be executed and managed via the UI without writing code.;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.6666666666666667
14;What permissions do team members have based on their role in an organization?;"Team members in a PlanQK organization can be assigned one of several roles, each with distinct permissions:

- Viewer: Can see the content of the organization but cannot edit or create content.
- Maintainer: Can create new content and edit existing content, but cannot delete content.
- Owner: Can create, edit, and delete all content within the organization. Owners can also add new members, assign roles, and delete members. Additionally, owners can view and edit the entire organization profile.

Members are added via the ""Members"" menu, and each receives an email invitation that must be confirmed before gaining access to the organization's context in their account dropdown menu. Please note, after creating new services, algorithms, or other content, you cannot change its context from personal to organization, so select the correct context before creating new content[source: https://docs.planqk.de/manage-organizations.html].

15;How can I limit resource usage during service setup to stay within budget?;"To control resource usage during service setup on PlanQK and help stay within budget, you can define resource limits when configuring your service. Specifically, you can set the number of virtual CPU cores, the amount of memory in GB, and, if needed, specify GPU resources and their type and count. These limits are defined in the resources section of your planqk.json configuration file. For example:

{
  ""resources"": {
    ""cpu"": 2,
    ""memory"": 4,
    ""gpu"": {
      ""type"": ""NVIDIA_TESLA_T4"",
      ""count"": 1
    }
  }
}

Adjust these values according to your budget and expected workload. Keeping CPU and memory allocations low will help reduce costs, and you can omit GPU configuration if it’s not required for your service. Each service execution will use the resources specified in this configuration, so setting conservative values ensures you don't exceed your budgetary constraints [doc10][doc3].

22;What benefits could this approach bring to a company’s IT security department?;"Managed Services on the PlanQK platform offer several benefits that could be valuable to a company's IT security department. By providing fully automated deployment and containerization of quantum code, IT teams do not need to manage their own infrastructure, provision servers, or perform hardware upgrades, reducing both operational complexity and potential security risks associated with manual server management. The services are accessible through standardized protocols (HTTP/S), enabling secure integration and simplified access control [doc1].

If custom environments are needed—for example, to ensure the use of specific OS-level security packages or compliance requirements—PlanQK supports custom Docker containers, giving IT departments full control over the base operating system and installed packages. This ensures reproducible builds and allows the use of programming languages not natively supported by PlanQK, which can be important for implementing security tools or protocols. However, it’s important to note that any custom containers must comply with PlanQK’s runtime interface to maintain security and compatibility [doc2][doc3].

Additionally, by focusing on code and configuration rather than infrastructure, IT security teams can allocate more resources to auditing, testing, and improving the quantum solutions themselves, rather than maintaining the underlying hardware and software stack [doc1].
