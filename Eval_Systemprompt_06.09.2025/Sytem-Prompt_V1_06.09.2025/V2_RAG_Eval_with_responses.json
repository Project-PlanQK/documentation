PLANQK provides tools and infrastructure to help address complex operational challenges using quantum and AI technologies, such as optimizing airspace capacity and reducing congestion.\n\nTo get started, could you clarify:\n- What type of data do you have available (e.g., flight schedules, airspace usage patterns, weather)?\n- Are you interested in exploring quantum algorithms, classical AI, or hybrid approaches for optimization?\n- Is your team looking to prototype, run experiments, or deploy production solutions?\n\nPLANQK offers Managed Services that let you run quantum code on-demand without managing your own infrastructure. You can focus on developing your optimization algorithms (in Python or other supported languages), while PLANQK handles deployment, scaling, and access via standard APIs. This can accelerate your experimentation and solution rollout for airspace capacity challenges. You can also leverage starter templates to rapidly build and deploy quantum solutions, and share them securely within your organization or with external partners via HTTP APIs [doc1][doc2].\n\nWould you like guidance on setting up a workspace, connecting your data, or exploring relevant quantum optimization use cases within PLANQK?\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?\nsource: https://platform.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction"
