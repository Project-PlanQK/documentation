28;What kind of data preprocessing is required before passing text to the quantum model?;"Thanks for your question regarding data preprocessing for quantum models on PlanQK.

Based on the available context, when passing input to a PLANQK Service (including quantum models), the required format is a JSON object, typically containing ""data"" and ""params"" fields. For text data, you should:

- Ensure your input text is structured as a JSON key-value map under the ""data"" field, e.g., { ""data"": { ""text"": ""your input text here"" }, ""params"": { ... } }.
- The ""data"" field should contain the actual text you wish to process.
- The ""params"" field can include additional parameters (such as model options or execution settings) relevant to your quantum job.
- The total input data passed by value (i.e., directly in the JSON) is limited to 1MB. For larger datasets, you should use the data pool mechanism and reference the file via ""dataRef"" instead of ""data"" [doc6].

Here are simplified steps for preprocessing text data:

1. Format your text data as a JSON object under the ""data"" field.
2. If you have additional settings, include them in the ""params"" field.
3. For large text files, upload them to the data pool and use a ""dataRef"" reference.
4. Ensure the overall input conforms to the expected JSON structure for the service.

If your quantum model has specific requirements for text preprocessing (such as tokenization, encoding, or normalization), those steps should be performed prior to constructing the JSON input, but such specifics are not detailed in the available context.
