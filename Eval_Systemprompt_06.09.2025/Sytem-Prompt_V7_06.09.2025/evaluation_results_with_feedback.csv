12;How can I check whether my model processes the provided data correctly?;"To check whether your model processes the provided data correctly on PlanQK, you should verify the following steps:

1. Ensure your service’s API specification (OpenAPI) defines the schema for both input data and parameters. This helps you validate that the API expects the correct data format when executing the service. For example, your InputData schema might specify an array of numbers, and your InputParams could include a boolean flag like round_up. You can use the integrated Swagger Editor on the Service Details page to review and edit your API specification, confirming it matches your model's requirements. source: https://platform.planqk.de/docs.planqk.de_services_managed_openapi.html.json

2. When you submit data to your service via the POST / endpoint, the PlanQK runtime passes the input as a JSON object in the format { ""data"": <data>, ""params"": <params> }. Your run() method should be defined to accept these arguments and process them accordingly. You can test this by sending example requests, such as:
   ```json
   {
     ""data"": { ""values"": [1, 2, 3] },
     ""params"": { ""round_up"": true }
   }
   ```
   The output should match your expected results, e.g., { ""sum"": 6 } if summing numbers. source: https://platform.planqk.de/docs.planqk.de_services_managed_runtime-interface.html.json

3. After executing the service, check the result using the GET /{id}/result endpoint. The response will contain the output generated by your run() method, allowing you to verify if the model processed the input as expected. You can also review the log output with GET /{id}/log for debugging purposes. source: https://platform.planqk.de/docs.planqk.de_services_managed_openapi.html.json

4. If you use a custom Docker container, ensure your input files (data.json and params.json) are correctly mounted to /var/runtime/input and processed by your application. You can test your container locally by providing input files in the input directory and running the container before deploying. source: https://platform.planqk.de/docs.planqk.de_services_managed_custom-containers.html.json

Based on your requirements, I recommend:
- Reviewing your API specification using the Swagger Editor to confirm the input/output formats.
