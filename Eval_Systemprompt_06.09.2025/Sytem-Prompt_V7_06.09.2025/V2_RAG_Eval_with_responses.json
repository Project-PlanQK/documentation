On the PlanQK platform, you can leverage managed quantum services and optimization models to address these types of problems without managing your own infrastructure.\n\nBased on your requirements, I recommend:\n- Exploring PlanQK’s managed services for quantum optimization, which allow you to run your code on-demand via HTTP APIs, focusing on Python and other supported languages. This enables rapid prototyping and deployment for use cases like traffic flow optimization, scheduling, and resource allocation.\n- Reviewing relevant tutorials and starter templates, such as those demonstrating how to solve complex combinatorial problems (e.g., Maximum Independent Set, which is structurally similar to congestion and resource allocation issues) using quantum SDKs like Qiskit or QuEra Aquila on the PlanQK platform.\n\nTo get started:\n1. Define your optimization problem (e.g., minimize congestion subject to airspace constraints).\n2. Use the PlanQK CLI or platform UI to create a Managed Service. Begin with a quantum optimization starter template in Python or Docker as appropriate for your team.\n3. Package your code and configuration, then deploy it as a managed service. You can execute jobs asynchronously and retrieve results via HTTP endpoints.\n4. Integrate with your existing systems by leveraging PlanQK's secure API authentication (using access tokens) and follow the provided quickstart guides for deployment.\n\nSource references:\n- Managed Services overview and quickstart: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html\n- Runtime interface and service configuration: https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/runtime-interface.html\n- Tutorials for quantum optimization (e.g., Maximum Independent Set): https://docs.planqk.de/tutorials/tutorial-quera-mis.html\n\nTo better assist you:\n- Could you specify the type and format of data you plan to use for modeling airspace congestion?\n- What is your intended deployment timeline, and do you have a preference for quantum or classical optimization?\n- Are you interested in integrating with existing Lufthansa systems, or is this a standalone proof of concept?\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with on PlanQK?"
