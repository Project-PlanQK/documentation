     from planqk.qiskit import PlanqkQuantumProvider
     planqk_token = ""YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""
     provider = PlanqkQuantumProvider(access_token=planqk_token)
     ```
   - If running inside a PLANQK service, the access token is automatically managed by the platform.

4. Select and Use a Quantum Backend:
   - List available backends and select one (e.g., azure.ionq.simulator):
     ```python
     backends = provider.backends()
     backend = provider.get_backend(""azure.ionq.simulator"")
     ```
   - Create and transpile your Qiskit circuit for the selected backend, then execute it:
     ```python
     from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
     circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
     circuit.h(0)
     circuit.cx(0, 1)
     circuit.cx(1, 2)
     circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
     circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
     job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1000)
     ```

5. Retrieve Results & Manage Jobs:
